# SummaryBot

This program is a summarizer I wrote that I linked to a Telegram Bot. This bot will take in your news articles or the like and
summarize them as best as it can. I had documented the codebase throughout, so please feel free to take a look and see how it works.

I would be more than happy to accept PRs to this project, however please respect the code convention used and the flow of the program if you wnat me to accept them.
